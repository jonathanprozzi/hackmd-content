Link to the Twitch recording: [https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1037083810](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1037083810)

- I'll be updating these notes with timestamps.

## Notes From the Livestream

**Topics:**

- DAO working styles and how this has been evolving
- Having a DAO that launches and in the first few weeks has thousands of participants and contributors
- What is Haus Party?
    - Haus Party is a podcast about DAOs — informal, much more like a conversation among friends.
    - Published on YouTube, goes live on Twitch

**Hosts & Guests**

- frog (frogmonkee)
- dekanbro
- Felipe Duarte

## Updates (DAOhaus Universe)

- Cool things happening with NFTs — collaboration with Rarible and proposal in the RaribleDAO
    - Integration for collector, curator DAOs based around NFTs
- MolochDAO vs. MolochDAOs
    - MolochDAO first DAO using this set of contracts, and does grants
    - MolochDAOs/DAOhaus DAOs have an aspect of the Moloch contracts (newer version of the contracts)
        - Key aspect is that *one* of the treasuries is owned. by DAO members through shares and weighted share governance (this is rage quittable)
        - Multiple treasuries (not all are rage quittable)
        - Maintained by community of open-source devs

## frog and BanklessDAO

- "Wanting to be DAOists together" → inviting folks into the community and onto Haus Party
- BanklessDAO created on May 4, 2021 → retroactive Airdrop to premium subs who had the Bankless Badge POAP and then opened up Discord to folks with $Bank token
- Started out radically decentralized: majority of holders are between 35K - 130K
- Dropped into a Discord, and organization and collaboration naturally emerging
- "DAO in name only" → DAO or digital organization?
    - Multisig with Bankless LLC
- "DAO experiment on steroids."
    - Thousands of members in the Discord community
    - Starting with lots of members as opposed to other DAOs starting with a smaller core of folks and growing from there
    - Working to establish a cadence and coordinating teams and squads
- First steps:
    - Very first steps (Airdrop and Discord setup) dictated by the LLC
    - Tiers based on tokens
    - > 35K is Level 0, 35K is Level 1, Collaborator is Level 2, 150K+ is Whale
        - Level system was subject of early conversations
        - To get Level 2 status, need to be invited to the Genesis team (or by people with the Contributor tag)
        - Liquidity Providers have separate status
    - Having levels baked into a hierarchy isn't ideal, so was a goal to get away from this quickly. There is no longer any gating and separation of channels (only separation is that Level 0 doesn't have *write* permission on channels but they are still *read-only*)

### DAO Structures and Organizational Structures

- Level System:
    - Not necessary bad — there are different levels of engagement
        - Different amounts of skin in the game → levels
    - How to differentiate folks with more skin in the game and more engagement/participation?
        - Is "level" the right terminology?
        - Could there be an internal, community mechanism for participation?
    - Similar conversations with folks rising to leadership levels, but must be careful that this isn't perceived (or elevated to) a hierarchy where there are folks who can individually fire someone from the DAO
- "Decentralization maxi" vs. "Coordination maxi"
    - Have legitimate ways of challenging decisions regardless of standing in the community — Letting arguments and conversations stand on their own
- **Storytelling, narrative, and language about how leadership structures are communicated is at the heart of discussion around DAO working styles**
    - Honeymoon phase of DAOs — need to be careful to avoid burnout at the onset
- "Progressive decentralization" — how far on the decentralization continuum to go?
- [Holocracy](https://www.holacracy.org/) ****organizational structure:
    - Instead of leadership decisions and hierarchies, you have roles that people occupy
    - Roles have responsibilities and specific domains
    - BanklessDAO has guilds comprised of folks with specific skillsets
    - Responsibilities, not positions of power
    - [Teal Organizations](https://workology.com/what-is-a-teal-organization/)
- *Emergence* is a powerful aspect of DAO/Wholocracy structures
    - Natural collaboration coming out of collaboration and cross-pollination across Guilds
    - *Soft-consensus* and rapidly expanding circles of consensus across participants in the DAO
        - Informal methods (such as emojis/upvotes, polls, etc.) in Discord channels
    - Talk about an idea → people naturally get interested and fill in the gaps and workshop the progression → informal proposal (power of *emergence* where folks collaborating and sharing ideas who may not otherwise have collaborated outside of this type of structure)
- **Roadmaps, Visions, Manifestos** are iterative documents that are changing over time but members can lean on these when there are disputes or discussion about forking
    - These documents can change, but these are the DAO's guiding principles, mission, and vision
    - There's always the future goal that the DAO is heading to
- Concept of *Seasons*
    - Periods of time focusing on particular objectives
    - Organize the work around objectives and initial goals on roadmap
    - Scope often smaller and very well defined
    - Do the work, focus on MVP, take notes on best practices and continuous improvement, share out the best practices and findings, iterate on process
- Developing revenue streams, building infrastructure to support these streams, growth, and scalability
- [https://frogmonkee.substack.com/p/coordinating-labor-in-daos-the-dao](https://frogmonkee.substack.com/p/coordinating-labor-in-daos-the-dao)
- Things once considered expert knowledge a few years ago are now much more available
- BanklessDAO is a *Media DAO*
    - DAO has been given a brand
    - Ethos has been well established and permeated throughout the DAO community
    - Mission-alignment on spreading the core message, vision, and values

### Token Distribution and Governance

- **"Tokens are capital and capital is power, especially with regards to governance."**
- How is value awarded? Especially when creating a brand with tremendous recognition and value (Bankless LLC team's work prior to the DAO launch)
    - How do you recognize this value retroactively?
- These types of treasuries could be a good use-case for a MolochDAO (as opposed to a multi-sig) as it's more scalable when including more folks

### Raid Guild Model

- Bankless Guilds are a good place for sub-DAO structures similar to Raid Guild to spin up
- Raid Guild model of coordinating folks with individual skillsets and mapping to projects is effective
    - "MVP of DAOs being able to coordinate labor to produce products and services."
- Bankless Guilds supporting initiatives of the DAO
- Would benefit from same coordination structure that Raid Guild pioneered and uses
- Natural overlap: Couldn't Raid Guild function as the Bankless Dev Guild?
- "DAO on DAO": Fuzzy structures hard to tell where one begins and ends
    - Squads and connections, high-intimacy groups built around skills become the stars (not necessarily the DAOs themselves)
- Raid Parties start with chats on channels and the people working on these ideas come from different talent groups
    - Raid Parties are a collection of various talents coming together to work on bringing forth a product/idea
- *Talent Driven* vs. *Purpose Driven* as organization structure of teams and groups
    - For larger projects, there often needs to be a higher-level view than strictly a talent driven team
- Potential inspiration for social structures: *Friends With Benefits*
- Raid Guild Origin: freelance product designers/developers loosely organizing into a model similar to a co-op, and then evolved into a "Front Tavern" and "Back Tavern"
    - Raid Party idea originating from a product development background and recognizing *coordination cost* often coming from adding lots of folks to a project team
    - Use the larger network as a resource talent pool but smaller, focused teams able to make lots of progress
    - Raid Guild started from group of 3 people and organically grew from that
- Sharing learning is so important and is an amplifier

## Looking Forward

- What does the future look like when there are multiple DAOs working together?
- Communities interacting with each other — what does this look like when each DAO potentially has its own token?
    - Can be viewed as similar to citizenships and a way to align incentives
- How will these types of alignments happen over time, and what will emerge?
- Holding tokens as way of being aligned with community
- Idea: Tie token to some theoretical amount of yield for holding it
- Conviction voting and Quadratic voting
